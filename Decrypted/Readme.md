**Every information leaked here is a result of my hard work for the Dragon's Oath modification. The list will be updated in the future when work with the Dragon's Oath modification will progress.

**The notes there are really raw. I won't waste my time to format the text or make it more clear until the final release of the Dragon's Oath won't come out. In the future I will make a tutorial for modders of the Dragon's Dogma.**
